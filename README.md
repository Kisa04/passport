#Passport
At times it is practically fast to access digital train / airplane qrcode tickets to showcase at a check-in. I wrote an app for that. All image files in a defined order (/sdcard1 /tickets/) are listed and displayed via enter.



## Installation


1. download [/build/passport.zip](/build/passport.zip) 
2. copy in sdcard/downloads/ on your phone 
3. installl the app with the GerdaOs Installer App.
4. create on your sd-card the dir "/tickets/' 


## How to use

+ Navigation up/down cursor
+ enter show the image

## To do
pdf support
