This app is written for the KaiOs

# Passport

At times it is practically fast to access digital train / airplane qrcode tickets to showcase at a check-in. I wrote an app for that. All images in the folder / passport / are listed. To avoid cumbersome copying from one device to another, a QR code can be scanned and saved with the app.

## How to install

The app is not available through the https://www.kaiostech.com/store/ They are only accepting apps that are monetized using KaiAds SDK, and that's something I'm not interested in integrating. For this reason, you have to side-load (upload) the app to your phone if you want to use it. Martin Kaptein wrote a comprehensive, step-by-step article that you can use to side-load the app. If you prefer a video, this one on YouTube walks you through the process. The Developer Portal also contains a guide, and if nothing seems to work, you can ask for help on Discord. You can download the latest version from the Releases page. The app is not auto-updating. To update it, you have to follow the same steps you took when installing it.

## How to use

- Navigation up/down cursor
- enter show the image
- soft-left to scan & save qr-code
- cursor left longpress to delete a file
