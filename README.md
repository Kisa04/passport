1. download [/build/custom-launcher.zip](/build/custom-launcher.zip) 
2. copy in sdcard/downloads/ on your phone 
3. installl the app with the GerdaOs Installer App.
4. Put on your sd card a file with the name custom-launcher.json with the following structure:

```

	{"app_name":"Audio"},
	{"app_name":"Gallery"},
	{"app_name":"rss-reader"},
	{"app_name":"osm-map", "dir":"outdoor"},
	{"app_name":"knots", "dir":"outdoor"},
	{"app_name":"shellCMD", "dir":"tools"},
	{"app_name":"Note", "dir":"tools"},

	{
		"weather":
		{
			"owm_api_key":"6d385b079ea964532d681348",
		
			"location":
			{
				"br√ºssel":
				{
					"position_lat":" 50.846557",
					"position_long":"4.3516970"

				},
				"prag":
				{
					"position_lat":"50.073658",
					"position_long":"14.418540"

				}
			}

		}
	}
]

```

5. you can also nest the apps in folders, "you": "myDir". They have to be put in order DirA, DirA, DirB, DirB as in my example.
6. if you want the weather forecast feature get your own api key from [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org) and put the api-key in "owm_api_key". You can set your default locations. Press soft-left to select your location.
